# Sentimental-Analysis-Wrapper-and-Filter-Based-Project
1.1 Introduction
Sentimental analysis is the process of extracting conclusions from the opinions of the people on a particular topic. People around the world are connected to each other through an enormous network of social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, twitter and some more.
Twitter with a wide range of users (more than 300 million users) and huge data is used by most of the researchers to get informative data to process the public opinion and collect the required feedback. Users communicate through their tweets having abbreviations, slangs, sarcasm, emoticons and much more.
Depression is a mental common illness faced worldwide by people of all ages. It is a type of illness which causes lack of interest in various activities, be it physical, emotional, social or anything leading to reducing one’s work efficiency.
Machine Learning (ML) methods such as Random Forest [4] and XG-Boost [3] are generally the most used ML models for classification and regression.
Here, we have performed sentimental analysis on a dataset acquired from Kaggle which contains tweets expressing the depression level of the people (0 for low and 1 for high) with the help of some wrapper and filter-based bio-inspired algorithms viz. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [1], Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) [2] .
These models were used to analyze the public opinions by comparing their accuracy to each other along with scatter plot.
